# Module-Eight
1.) Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The client for this project was The Gaming Room. The client was looking to update the functionality of their game "Draw It or Lose It". They are seeking to expand the game to multiple platforms while updating toa web based version of the game.

2.) What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I feel like I was able to undestand and approach the UML diagram the best as it was the easiest to understand and formulate. However, I probably had the most fun with the recommendations section. I felt like it really allowed me to do extra research on topics that I didn't fully understand and I felt like I did a decent job.

3.) What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
I felt like starting from the beginning the project was introduced in a manner that built upon itself. It allowed for the building of knowledge starting with the UML diagram and working into more difficult parts like recommendations. 
Personally, I wouldn't know what or how to recommend anything to the client had I not learned about everything prior in a step by step way.

4.) If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I could choose one part of my work to revise it would likely be the recommendations portion. As I gain more knowledge around the topic and subject matter I feel I would ultimatly be able to make better recommendations to the client overall.

5.) How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The user's needs are the first thing taken into consideration when looking at designing software. I feel it's important to look at the clients end goal and using your own knowledge to help the make the best decisions that will end up with the best overall user experience.
Sometimes, the client may have an idea of how they want something approached but may not have any idea of how it could impact the design or their user base as a whole. 

6.) How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
My approach starts with trying to understand both the product as well as the develomental direction its taking. For future software that is similar the same steps could be taken. However, the details are going to be different depending on the type of product and ultimately the end goal of the client.
